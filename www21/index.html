        <h1 class="headline">Machine Learning-Driven Ad Blocking: From Data Collection to Deployment</h1>
        <div class="abstract">
            In this hands-on tutorial, we’ll give you an introduction to our journey of machine learning-based ad blocking, 
            the research we have performed and our results. Together we’ll set up a website crawling service which produces 
            datasets for self-supervised training, we’ll transform the crawled data into graphs, train a graph-based machine 
            learning model and deploy it in a browser extension in order to run inference in the browser and block ads. The goal 
            of this session is to give you an overview of how a machine learning project with a similar scope can be tackled and how 
            to develop basic components ranging from data gathering to a simple extension which makes use of the data you trained 
            your ML model with.

                <p class="text">
                    At the root of most of the adblockers stay a set of manually-curated filterlists (most well-known of which being 
                    <a href="https://github.com/easylist">Easylist</a>). The bigger these filterlists get, the more difficult it is to
                    maintain them, since it becomes challenging to understand which filters are outdated and which ones are not.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Moreover, these filterlists are hardly scalable, with every new ad requiring a new filter most of the time. This leads
                    to an increased file size and to a less performant adblocker. Down the road, this means a poor experience for the end-user
                    and we don't want that.

                <h1 class="subsubtitle">Why ML?</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    Ok, so we talked about how adblockers work currently and what the issues are with this. Now you might be wondering "Why 
                    use Machine Learning? Why not something else?". Fundamentally, adblocking is a pattern-recognition problem. And most of
                    the models used in modern ML, such as neural networks are optimised just for that.

                    This is why we, the Automated Adblocking Team from <a href="https://eyeo.com/">eyeo GmbH</a> (the company behind 
                    <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">AdblockPlus</a>), are exploring ways in which different kind of models might be 
                    applied here. These models include, but are not limited to: graph-based models, OCR, image recognition and NLP.

                In this tutorial, we will walk through one of our latest exploratory projects attempted by our team that we like to call "Project Moonshot".
                In a few words, we'll attempt to take a webpage's DOM tree, find a graph-based model that could identify which sections should be blocked
                or not and finally put it in the adblocking extension. In more technical words, we'll go through:

                    <p class="bolded text">Data collecting - JavaScript</p>
                    <p class="text">
                        We'll extend <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">AdblockPlus</a> and make it work as an automatic labelled data collector and then
                        we'll look into how we can fully automate this step by setting up a crawler.

                    <p class="text">
                        After we collect the data, we look at how it looks like and what we can do to get it ready to be used in model training.

                    <p class="text">
                        With the data prepared, we'll try to train a model and see how well it can learn to classify parts of the DOM tree.

                        In this last section of the tutorial, we'll try to first reproduce the data preprocessing pipeline in JavaScript and finally to 
                        deploy the model in the extension in order to test it in a real-life scenario.
